This Super shop inventory management system consists of product, product info, supply, supplier, sale tables.
The functionalities of this system can be pointed from the view of an admin.
Those are:
•	When new supply arrives, supplier, product and product info- all these tables will be updated automatically.
•	When a new product gets enlisted but the supplier is already in database, then supply will be updated but product and product info tables will get a new row for the new product.
•	When a product is sold, that data is inserted in sale table and the product stock will be reduced from product info.
•	If any product is not available it will show a message.
•	If the quantity of any product lowers than ten, then it will show a "low stock" message.
